This library allows populating an S3 bucket with the contents of .zip files
from other S3 buckets or from local disk.

The following example defines a publicly accessible S3 bucket with web hosting
enabled and populates it from a local directory on disk.

```python
# Example may have issues. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
website_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "WebsiteBucket",
    website_index_document="index.html",
    public_read_access=True
)

s3deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWebsite",
    sources=[s3deploy.Source.asset("./website-dist")],
    destination_bucket=website_bucket,
    destination_key_prefix="web/static"
)
```

This is what happens under the hood:

1. When this stack is deployed (either via `cdk deploy` or via CI/CD), the
   contents of the local `website-dist` directory will be archived and uploaded
   to an intermediary assets bucket. If there is more than one source, they will
   be individually uploaded.
2. The `BucketDeployment` construct synthesizes a custom CloudFormation resource
   of type `Custom::CDKBucketDeployment` into the template. The source bucket/key
   is set to point to the assets bucket.
3. The custom resource downloads the .zip archive, extracts it and issues `aws s3 sync --delete` against the destination bucket (in this case
   `websiteBucket`). If there is more than one source, the sources will be
   downloaded and merged pre-deployment at this step.

## Supported sources

The following source types are supported for bucket deployments:

* Local .zip file: `s3deploy.Source.asset('/path/to/local/file.zip')`
* Local directory: `s3deploy.Source.asset('/path/to/local/directory')`
* Another bucket: `s3deploy.Source.bucket(bucket, zipObjectKey)`

## Retain on Delete

By default, the contents of the destination bucket will be deleted when the
`BucketDeployment` resource is removed from the stack or when the destination is
changed. You can use the option `retainOnDelete: true` to disable this behavior,
in which case the contents will be retained.

## Objects metadata

You can specify metadata to be set on all the objects in your deployment.
There are 2 types of metadata in S3: system-defined metadata and user-defined metadata.
System-defined metadata have a special purpose, for example cache-control defines how long to keep an object cached.
User-defined metadata are not used by S3 and keys always begin with `x-amzn-meta-` (if this is not provided, it is added automatically).

System defined metadata keys include the following:

* cache-control
* content-disposition
* content-encoding
* content-language
* content-type
* expires
* server-side-encryption
* storage-class
* website-redirect-location
* ssekms-key-id
* sse-customer-algorithm

```python
# Example may have issues. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
website_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "WebsiteBucket",
    website_index_document="index.html",
    public_read_access=True
)

s3deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWebsite",
    sources=[s3deploy.Source.asset("./website-dist")],
    destination_bucket=website_bucket,
    destination_key_prefix="web/static", # optional prefix in destination bucket
    user_metadata={"A": "1", "b": "2"}, # user-defined metadata

    # system-defined metadata
    content_type="text/html",
    content_language="en",
    storage_class=StorageClass.INTELLIGENT_TIERING,
    server_side_encryption=ServerSideEncryption.AES_256,
    cache_control=[CacheControl.set_public(), CacheControl.max_age(cdk.Duration.hours(1))]
)
```

## CloudFront Invalidation

You can provide a CloudFront distribution and optional paths to invalidate after the bucket deployment finishes.

```python
# Example may have issues. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Destination")

distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "Distribution",
    origin_configs=[{
        "s3_origin_source": {
            "s3_bucket_source": bucket
        },
        "behaviors": [{"is_default_behavior": True}]
    }
    ]
)

s3deploy.BucketDeployment(self, "DeployWithInvalidation",
    sources=[s3deploy.Source.asset("./website-dist")],
    destination_bucket=bucket,
    distribution=distribution,
    distribution_paths=["/images/*.png"]
)
```

## Memory Limit

The default memory limit for the deployment resource is 128MiB. If you need to
copy larger files, you can use the `memoryLimit` configuration to specify the
size of the AWS Lambda resource handler.

> NOTE: a new AWS Lambda handler will be created in your stack for each memory
> limit configuration.

## Notes

* This library uses an AWS CloudFormation custom resource which about 10MiB in
  size. The code of this resource is bundled with this library.
* AWS Lambda execution time is limited to 15min. This limits the amount of data which can
  be deployed into the bucket by this timeout.
* When the `BucketDeployment` is removed from the stack, the contents are retained
  in the destination bucket ([#952](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/952)).
* Bucket deployment *only happens* during stack create/update. This means that
  if you wish to update the contents of the destination, you will need to
  change the source s3 key (or bucket), so that the resource will be updated.
  This is inline with best practices. If you use local disk assets, this will
  happen automatically whenever you modify the asset, since the S3 key is based
  on a hash of the asset contents.

## Development

The custom resource is implemented in Python 3.6 in order to be able to leverage
the AWS CLI for "aws sync". The code is under [`lambda/src`](./lambda/src) and
unit tests are under [`lambda/test`](./lambda/test).

This package requires Python 3.6 during build time in order to create the custom
resource Lambda bundle and test it. It also relies on a few bash scripts, so
might be tricky to build on Windows.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Support "progressive" mode (no `--delete`) ([#953](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/953))
* [ ] Support "blue/green" deployments ([#954](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/954))
